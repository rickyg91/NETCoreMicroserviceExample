# Microservices API
## Built with .NET Core in Visual Studio

This is a sample Microservice to store products in a database with details such as Id, name, description etc.
These products are also linked to a category which is stored in its own table and linked via a Category Id.

I have implemented simple CRUD methods to update the database.
